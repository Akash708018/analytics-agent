# Decisions

Machine-local and implementation choices that are easy to forget six months later. Product locks stay in the build guide (Section 13). This file is the “why did we do *that*?” log.

## 2026-08-28 — One Homebrew PostgreSQL 17 cluster for `olist` and `testdb`

**Status:** Done (Step 0.5)

**Context.** Port 5432 had two competing clusters. Postgres.app’s PostgreSQL 18 data directory held the real `olist` warehouse. Homebrew’s PostgreSQL 17 (the version the build guide allows: 16 or 17) was serving `testdb` from Phase 1 and was otherwise empty. Whoever bound 5432 first won; the other looked “down” or empty depending on which postmaster was listening.

**Decision.** Rebuild `olist` from the original CSVs into the Homebrew PG 17 cluster. Do not dump-and-restore 18 → 17 (major-version downgrade). Then retire Postgres.app and delete its cluster.

**Why CSV rebuild, not a dump.** `pg_dump` from 18 is not a supported restore target for 17. Recreating the schema and loading the public Olist CSVs is the faithful path, and it is independently checkable against known warehouse totals.

**Sequence (this order mattered).**

1. Load CSVs into Homebrew PG 17 `olist`.
2. Gate: checksum against the old cluster — `SUM(payment_value)` = **15371741.09**, exact match.
3. Quit / remove Postgres.app so it cannot grab 5432 again.
4. Re-verify on the remaining postmaster: **99,441** orders in `olist`.
5. Delete Postgres.app’s leftover data directory (`var-18`, **418 MB**).

**Outcome.** Postgres.app is gone, `var-18` is gone, and a single PostgreSQL 17 cluster on 5432 serves both `olist` and `testdb`. Source alias `olist` in `~/.analytics-agent/sources.yaml` stays `host=localhost port=5432 dbname=olist`.
